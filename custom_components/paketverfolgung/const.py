# The same int-verfolgen/data/search endpoint, called WITHOUT a piececode
# but WITH `Cookie: dhli=<id_token>`, returns the shipments linked to the
# logged-in DHL account. The login is the DHL app's OAuth/PKCE flow: the
# user opens a login URL, signs in, DHL redirects to a `dhllogin://` URL,
# and that URL's `code` is exchanged for tokens. Parameters lifted from
# the iOS DHL app (package de.deutschepost.dhl) - may break if DHL rotates
# them. Opt-in: either as its own "DHL-Konto" entry (recommended) or - as
# before - as a switch on the "Sendungsnummern" entry.
